# Forever Stack

A stack of everything, together, forever

## Docker Compose Stack

- NGINX
- Postgres Db
- Perl localhost
- PHP localhost
- NextJs, tailwind, shadcn, drizzle orm
- Java Backend
- Go Backend
- Ruby Backend
- Python Backend
- Colfusion

### Drizzle ORM

This will manage migrations, type safety, and a basic API.

Each of the other services will be on different ports, however the nginx proxy will link them all under localhost.

### Localhost

On port 80 will be the NextJs server rendering react.
