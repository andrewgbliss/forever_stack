Using the README.md file @README.md 
Read this file
FIrst make a docker-compose.yml file that the readme says to make.
Make all the services and link them together with nginx.
Make an .env file with the needs vars, and make a file called .sample.env for default values

---

Context:

You'll need to create the following directory structure with Dockerfiles for each service:

```
.
├── docker-compose.yml
├── .env
├── .sample.env
├── nginx/
│   └── nginx.conf
├── nextjs/
│   └── Dockerfile
├── perl/
│   └── Dockerfile
├── php/
│   └── Dockerfile
├── java/
│   └── Dockerfile
├── go/
│   └── Dockerfile
└── ruby/
    └── Dockerfile
```

Now create the folder for each service and their Dockerfile

---

Make a .gitignore to ignore any .env or build folders, .next

---

make the docker compose file use the .env

---

take off the env vars found in the file and use the .env file
